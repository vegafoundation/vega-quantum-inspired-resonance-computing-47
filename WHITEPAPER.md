## Executive Summary

This white paper presents Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing as a conceptual contribution within 
the Resonance Data and QIRC (Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing) paradigm.

Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing is not an implementation, not quantum hardware, and not new physics.
It is a theoretical framework for understanding meaning, insight, and wisdom 
in artificial and hybrid systems.

---

## Motivation

Current AI systems excel at:
- Storing information
- Computing similarity
- Generating responses

They struggle to:
- Stabilize insight over time
- Preserve wisdom as coherent meaning
- Model decisions beyond ranking

Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing addresses this gap conceptually.

## Core Concept

**Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing** defines a new layer or mechanism within resonance-based systems.

Key aspects:
1. **Resonance over Similarity** — Relevance through resonance, not distance
2. **Insight as Event** — Recognition as a resonance transition
3. **Wisdom as Temporal Coherence** — Stability over time
4. **Decision as Collapse** — Choice as state collapse, not ranking

## Non-Claims (VSP Compliant)

This white paper explicitly does NOT:
- ✘ Introduce new physics
- ✘ Require quantum hardware
- ✘ Claim consciousness or sentience
- ✘ Disclose algorithms or code
- ✘ Reveal system architectures

---

## Conclusion

Quantum-Inspired Resonance Computing is a foundational contribution, not a product.
It establishes prior art and provides a language for future research 
and development within the Vega Continuum.
